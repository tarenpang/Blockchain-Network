<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### Project Overview

The IndiGOLD Blockchain application is a class project for the <a href="https://kingslanduniversity.com/zero-to-blockchain-developer-program/">Kingsland University 'Zero to Blockchain' Program.</a> Our application leverages the React frontend library to illustrate the functionality of a complete proof-of-work blockchain network.
<br>

### Technical Requirements

Build a proof-of-work blockchain system that includes:

- Nodes
- Miners
- Faucet
- Wallets
- Explorer

Build a blockchain network server and implement a RESTful API for client-server communiation. The frontend shall include:

- Explorer
- Wallet
- Faucet
- Nodes Monitoring
- Mining Dashboard

Workflow: Use GitHub for version control. Each team member shall make a minimum of two pull requests.

### Team Response to Requirements

<b>Technical requirements:</b>

<ol>
    <li>Backend: Node.js and JavaScript</li>
    <li>Frontend: React and Vite</li>
    <li>RESTful APIs are used to enable the frontend to access the data and business logic on the backend.</li>
    <li>Websockets are used to stream data from the backend and display real-time hash rate values on the frontend.</li>
</ol>

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<b>Workflow requirements:</b>

<ol>
    <li>A GitHub repository was created.</li>
    <li>Team members were added as collaborators.</li>
    <li>Collaborators cloned the repo & each started a new branch.</li>
    <li>Collaborators on GitHub:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>used Pull Requests, making sure to tag a reviewer for approval.</li>
      <li>worked on branches of Main and merged our work through Pull Requests.</li>
      <li>had other teammates be Reviewers for their Pull Requests.</li>
    <ul>  
</ol>

### Built With

- [node.js](https://https://nodejs.org)
- [React](https://https://react.dev)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)

<!-- USAGE  -->

## GitHub Repo and Usage

Visitors are encouraged to go to our GitHub repository to examine the code behind the functionality of the web app.

GitHub Link: [https://https://github.com/tarenpang/Blockchain-Network](https://https://github.com/tarenpang/Blockchain-Network)

<ol>
    <li><b>npm install</b> - in each of the following directories:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>blockchain</li>
      <li>backend</li>
      <li>frontend</li>
</ol>

<li>Start the app in the blockchain directory: <b>npm run start</b></li>

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Known Issues

The following are known, open issues:

<ol>
  <li><b> Competitive mining is not fully implemented.</b> Competitive mining among miner nodes is a stretch goal that has not been fully implemented. The framework has been established to set the number of child processes independently for each node to simulate varying miner processing capacities. However, the way the local host computer allocates resources to running processes may be skewing the mining results. In other words, nodes that have more parallel child processes are not always the fastest to reach the required difficulty. We are in the process of investigating methods for correcting these skewed results.</li><br>
  <li><b>Application is not optimized for mobile-first, responsive design.</b>The frontend can be improved to provide a better user experience. In particular, rendered elements can be made to be more responsive on mobile devices. Our team will be looking at ways to implement this on the next iteration of the application.</li><br>
